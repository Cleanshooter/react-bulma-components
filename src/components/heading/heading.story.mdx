The `Heading` component combines title and subtitle styles into one component.

## Sizes

There are 6 sizes available for both title and subtitle.
By default, title has a size of 3, and subtitle has a size of 5.

<Story story={stories.HeadingSizes} />

<br />

<Story story={stories.SubheadingSizes} />

## Spacing

When you put title and subtitle together the spacing between them will be reduced.
The official documentation recommends that the size difference between title and subtitle should be 2.
For example, if your title has a size of 5, your subtitle should have a size of 3.
